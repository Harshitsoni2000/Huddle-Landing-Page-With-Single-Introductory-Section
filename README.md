## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css) - For styles

### What I learned

We can center the fab-icons both horizontally and vertically within the circles using FlexBox.

```html
<div class="fab-circles"><i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i></div>
```
```css
.fab-circles {
  display: inline-flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on learning flexbox and grid layout more. This is the concept that I need a lot of practice to get comfortable with.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped a lot while using Flexbox layout. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
